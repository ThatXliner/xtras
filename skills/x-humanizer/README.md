Part of the [**xtras**](../../README.md) plugin.

Rewrites AI-generated text so it reads like a considered essay instead of a marketing blog post. It focuses on rhythm and sentence mechanics — how the writing feels when read aloud.

## Rules

- **No rhetorical fragments** — every sentence stands grammatically complete on its own. "It's not a promise. It's a confession." becomes "It isn't a promise so much as a confession."
- **No staccato pairs/triples** — short sentences belonging together get joined with a semicolon, a comma-and-conjunction, or a subordinate clause.
- **No one-line punchline paragraphs** — each paragraph develops a thought across multiple sentences.
- **No em-dashes as dramatic pauses** — where a comma, parenthesis, or "because" clause does the same work more quietly, use that.
- **No list-style sentences** — "There's X. There's Y. There's Z." becomes a real list or a single sentence with parallel clauses.
- **Sentences finish their own thought** — no sentence relies on the next to complete it.

## The read-aloud test

Read any single sentence in isolation. It should stand up grammatically and feel complete on its own. If it only works because of what comes before or after, rewrite it.

## What it preserves

Keeps the argument, the structure, and the voice. Changes only the rhythm and sentence mechanics.

## Example

**Before:**
> AI assistants are changing everything. Not incrementally. Fundamentally. The way we write code, compose emails, and even think through problems — it's all shifting. It's not just about saving time. It's about reimagining what's possible.
>
> This is exciting. It's also terrifying.

**After:**
> AI assistants are changing everything, not incrementally but fundamentally. The way we write code, compose emails, and even think through problems is all shifting, and the question is not just about saving time but about reimagining what's possible. This is exciting, and it is also terrifying.

## Usage

The skill activates when you ask Claude to humanize, edit, or review text for AI tells.
